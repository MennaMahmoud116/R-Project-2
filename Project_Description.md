Huntington's disease | Microarray Analysis

This is a group project that consist of three members: Ahmed Ibrahim, Menna Mahmoud, and Ahmed Hassan. 

Analyzing a microarray dataset using R. The dataset was published with a study that suggested a genome-wide expression profiling of human blood reveals biomarkers for Huntington’s disease. This project aims to make a microarray analysis of Global Gene Expression changes in blood of HD patients and to identify a differentially expressed gene and comment on its possible association with the Huntington’s disease.
